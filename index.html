Least Ethical: You automatically reject the applicant because of their influential parents | You consider the applicant's qualifications and merit but also take into account any potential connections

Unethical: You favor the applicant solely because of their influential parents

Most Ethical: You distribute resources based on a balanced approach

Partially Correct: Consider the impact of prestige alongside other factors while allocating funds

This approach balances the efficiency of AI with the need for responsible and thoughtful human decision-making in delicate matters.

Student Records with LLM

Unethical: Yes, especially when time is less

Summary: Using language models as a tool to assist in generating feedback but emphasizing the importance of human review and customization before finalizing grades and feedback, is a more ethical approach.

Summary: In response to the awareness of widespread cheating, the ethical approaches (1, 3) focus on conducting thorough investigations, implementing educational outreach for prevention, and maintaining transparency and communication. On the contrary, the unethical responses (2, 4) involve covering up cheating incidents to protect the institution's reputation, and unfairly blaming and punishing instructors without proper evidence.
