        <h4>Management ((Focus group))</h4>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You are a project lead with 3 RAs. One of them has a disability due to which they are delayed in submitting their task. This extension means that the time of the other RAs will stall. What do you do?</p>
        <p><strong>Most Ethical Response:</strong> Accommodate the disability and pace everyone accordingly</p>
        <p><strong>Partially Correct:</strong> Segregate and distribute the work at different times so that everyone can work at their own pace</p>
        <p><strong>Least Ethical Response:</strong> nan</p>
        <p><strong>Universally Incorrect:</strong> Ask the other RAs to help the RA in need</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In summary, the most ethical and inclusive approaches is 3, which involve accommodating the disability and adjusting the project timeline, respectively. These approaches balance the needs of the RA with a disability and the overall project progress while fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment. Option 4 may also be viable depending on the project's nature, but it requires effective project management. Option 2, ignoring the situation and imposing consequences, is not recommended as it disregards the individual's needs and equality in the workplace.</p>
