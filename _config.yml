credits: 'Welcome to the Fair Game project website, a hub for exploring academic integrity and ethical dilemmas through interactive and gamified learning. This project, funded by the SATLE (Strategic Alignment of Teaching and Learning Enhancement) initiative, has developed a collection of scenarios designed to challenge and engage students, educators, and researchers in navigating real-world ethical challenges. Here, you will find a curated selection of academic integrity dilemmas, ranging from responsible research practices to ethical decision-making in scientific and academic settings. These scenarios were collaboratively developed with students and faculty to provide meaningful insights into integrity-related challenges in higher education. The materials and resources available on this site can be used for training, discussion, and game-based learning, supporting a deeper understanding of ethical principles in academia. Explore the scenarios, test your decision-making skills, and join us in fostering a culture of integrity and responsibility!'
