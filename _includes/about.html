          Welcome to the Fair Game project website, a hub for exploring academic integrity and ethical dilemmas through interactive and gamified learning.
          This project, funded by the SATLE (Strategic Alignment of Teaching and Learning Enhancement) initiative, has developed a collection of scenarios
          designed to challenge and engage students, educators, and researchers in navigating real-world ethical challenges. Here, you will find a curated
          selection of academic integrity dilemmas, ranging from responsible research practices to ethical decision-making in scientific and academic settings.
          The materials and resources available on this site can be used for training, discussion, and game-based learning, supporting a deeper understanding
          of ethical principles in academia.
